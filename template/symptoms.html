            <h1>Causes and Symptoms of Heart Disease:-</h1>
            
            <h3 style="font-size: 2.5rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Causes of Heart Disease:- </h3>
            <p>Heart disease, also known as cardiovascular disease, refers to a range of conditions that affect the heart and blood vessels. It is a leading cause of death worldwide. There are several factors and causes that contribute to the development of heart disease, and these can often interact in complex ways. Here are some of the primary causes and risk factors for heart disease:</p>

            <p style="margin-top: 1.5rem"><span style="font-size: 1.7rem; font-weight: 600;">Atherosclerosis: </span>The most common cause of heart disease, atherosclerosis involves the buildup of plaque (composed of cholesterol, fat, calcium, and other substances) in the arteries, narrowing them and reducing blood flow to the heart.</p>

            <p style="margin-top: 1.5rem"><span style="font-size: 1.7rem; font-weight: 600;">High Blood Pressure (Hypertension): </span>THigh blood pressure can damage the arteries and heart, making them more susceptible to disease.</p>

            <p style="margin-top: 1.5rem"><span style="font-size: 1.7rem; font-weight: 600;">High Cholesterol: </span>Elevated levels of LDL (low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol, often referred to as "bad" cholesterol, can contribute to the formation of plaque in the arteries.</p>

            <p style="margin-top: 1.5rem"><span style="font-size: 1.7rem; font-weight: 600;">Smoking: </span>Smoking is a major risk factor for heart disease. It can damage the blood vessels and decrease the oxygen supply to the heart.</p>

            <p style="margin-top: 1.5rem"><span style="font-size: 1.7rem; font-weight: 600;">Diabetes: </span>People with diabetes are at a higher risk of heart disease due to elevated blood sugar levels that can damage blood vessels.</p>

            <p style="margin-top: 1.5rem"><span style="font-size: 1.7rem; font-weight: 600;">Obesity: </span>Excess weight, especially around the abdomen, can increase the risk of heart disease.</p>

            <p style="margin-top: 1.5rem"><span style="font-size: 1.7rem; font-weight: 600;">Physical Inactivity: </span>A sedentary lifestyle can lead to weight gain and increase the risk of heart disease.</p>

            <p style="margin-top: 1.5rem"><span style="font-size: 1.7rem; font-weight: 600;">Family History: </span>A family history of heart disease can increase an individual's risk.</p>

            <p style="margin-top: 1.5rem; margin-bottom: 4rem;"><span style="font-size: 1.7rem; font-weight: 600;">Stress: </span>Chronic stress can contribute to heart disease through various mechanisms, including raising blood pressure and promoting unhealthy behaviours.
            </p>

            <!-- ====== Symptoms of Heart Disease:- ==== -->
            <h3 style="font-size: 2.5rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Symptoms of Heart Disease:</h3>
            <p>Symptoms can vary depending on the specific condition, but common signs of heart disease include:- </p>

            <!-- ==== Body === -->
            <p style="margin-top: 1.5rem"><span style="font-size: 1.7rem; font-weight: 600;">Chest Pain (Angina): </span>Angina is a common symptom of heart disease. It often presents as a feeling of discomfort, pressure, tightness, or pain in the chest. The pain may radiate to the arms, shoulders, neck, jaw, or back. It typically occurs when the heart muscle doesn't receive enough oxygen-rich blood, often due to narrowed or blocked coronary arteries.</p>

            <p style="margin-top: 1.5rem"><span style="font-size: 1.7rem; font-weight: 600;">Shortness of Breath: </span>Heart disease can lead to difficulty breathing, especially during physical exertion. This symptom can be caused by the heart's reduced ability to pump blood effectively, leading to a backup of fluid in the lungs.</p>

            <p style="margin-top: 1.5rem"><span style="font-size: 1.7rem; font-weight: 600;">Fatigue: </span>Unexplained or excessive fatigue can be a sign of heart disease. As the heart's pumping capacity diminishes, the body may receive less oxygen and nutrients, leading to feelings of tiredness and weakness.</p>

            <p style="margin-top: 1.5rem"><span style="font-size: 1.7rem; font-weight: 600;">Palpitations: </span>Irregular heartbeats, skipped beats, or a rapid heartbeat can be associated with heart disease. These palpitations may be due to arrhythmias (abnormal heart rhythms), which can be triggered by various heart conditions.
            </p>

            <p style="margin-top: 1.5rem"><span style="font-size: 1.7rem; font-weight: 600;">Dizziness or Fainting: </span>Insufficient blood flow to the brain, caused by heart issues, can lead to dizziness or fainting. This is more common in advanced heart disease or when there are significant disruptions in heart rhythm.</p>

            <p style="margin-top: 1.5rem"><span style="font-size: 1.7rem; font-weight: 600;">Swelling (Edema): </span>Heart disease can cause fluid retention in various parts of the body. Swelling in the legs, ankles, or abdomen is a common sign. It occurs when the heart is unable to effectively pump blood, leading to fluid accumulating in the body's tissues.</p>

            <p style="margin-top: 1.5rem; padding-bottom: 10rem;">Nausea and Indigestion: Some individuals, particularly women, may experience symptoms resembling indigestion, heartburn, or nausea as a manifestation of heart disease. This can be confusing, but it's essential not to ignore these symptoms, especially if they are unusual for you. </p>
