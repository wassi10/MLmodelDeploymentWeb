This web system, built on the Django framework, employs a user-centric approach, ensuring transparency and engagement. The "Home Page" serves as the entry point, facilitating easy navigation. Subsequent sections like "Model Analysis," "Our Team," and "About Us" provide clarity on the research team, methodologies, and analytical models used.

Operating primarily to predict heart disease, users engage by inputting attribute values. Algorithms then assess this input, determining the risk of heart disease. In case of a positive prediction, the system offers proactive guidance, suggesting healthcare professionals, facilities, and prevention tips, empowering users in heart health management. Conversely, if no heart disease is predicted, the system assures users of their healthy status, providing a percentage likelihood.

After prediction, the system generates a comprehensive "Prediction Report," offering users a detailed overview of their health status.
